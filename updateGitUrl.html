  After getting this site/repository created within GitHub, every push I made to GitHub required I enter my username and password.
  I know I had setup an SSH key with my development machine, so I was pretty sure I was just using the wrong protocol/URL.  I 
  needed to update my remote repository's URL/protocol.  Quick google search gave me 
  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/">this</a>, which of course I didn't bother to fully read
  (until now when I'm writing this).  So it has the answer, but as quick ref it is 
  <code>git remote set-url origin <i>URL</i></code>
