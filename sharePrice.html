    Do you know what dollar-cost averaging is?  Go look it up, you should.  
    That's great for acquiring stocks overtime, but what about selling them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal is to sell our stocks at the highest possible price in a systematic way.
    The method is selling a set number of shares on a defined interval.
  </p>
  <p>
    Benefit: you sell the most value of shares at the highest price, the counter
    to buying the most number of shares at the lowest price.  This method
    ensures you realize the average gain between when you buy and sell a stock,
    i.e. if you were to both buy and sell over the same period you would end up
    at $0.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anticomparison: Buy set number of stocks on interval and sell set value of stocks
    over period.  (You lose, that's what happens)
  </p>
  <p>
    Problems: The main problem with this I see is that people like a fixed income
    which for a volatile stock this might not give.  This is probably more key to
    retirement accounts that are supposed to adjust to more secure investments over
    time.  This would state that they shouldn't do it in one transaction, where they
    sell one investment and use those funds to buy another one.  Instead you should
    sell a set number of shares and buy a fixed value each interval.
